# Artificial Intelligence Lab Practicals
This repo contains my AI Lab practicals for Semester 5.

## Practical 1: Smart Light Agent
- File: practical_1_AI.ipynb
- Simple Reflex Agent that controls a smart light.
- Turns **ON** when a human is present and no sunlight is available.
- Otherwise, keep the light **OFF**.

## Practical 2: Two-Room Vacuum Cleaner Agent
- File: practical_2_AI.ipynb
- Vacuum starts in **Room A**.
- Cleans the room if dirty, else moves to the other room.
- Repeats until both rooms are clean.

## Notes
- Implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook).
- Written in a simple, self-explanatory way for lab submission.
